Step 1: Download the "test_db_master" zip file from the GitHub repository. You can find it at https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db.

Step 2: Unzip the downloaded "test_db_master" zip file to access its contents.

Step 3: Inside the unzipped folder, you will find an "employees.sql" script. Open this SQL script and select all the content. Then, run the script to create the necessary database tables.

Step 4: Access your database server (e.g., MySQL) and navigate to the "Data Import" section. Choose the option to import a specific file and select the dump file included in the "test_db_master" folder. This file should have a .sql extension and contain the data for the database.

Step 5: After successfully importing the data, open the "project.sql" file. Go through all the SQL queries in this script to perform your desired data analysis.

These steps should help you set up the database and run the queries for analyzing employee data from the provided GitHub repository.
